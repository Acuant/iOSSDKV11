## Opening Issues
* You are *required* to use one of the existing Issue types (Bug Report or Feature Request). The information requested in those templates help elminate unneccessary back and forth comments to address the problem. **Any issues that are opened without filling out a template will not be reviewed and will be immediately closed**.
* As a general rule of thumb, those who open a feature request will be encouraged to implement the feature themselves. The project has been made extensible so features that aren't covered by this project can be implemented in a thread-safe manner.
* Including sample code (preferrably hosted on GitHub) is **highly** recommended for Bug Reports.
* *Any* issues with `libtesseract` should be opened on the [SwiftyTesseract/libtesseract](https://github.com/SwiftyTesseract/libtesseract) repo.

## Pull Requests
* You must include test cases and inline documentation for any new features
* New features for the `support/3.x.x` branch will not be accepted.
